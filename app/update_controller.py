"""PDFApps – UpdateController: the MainWindow auto-update subsystem.

Extracted verbatim from ``app/window.py`` (R4 refactor). Owns the
background update-check worker (a ``QObject`` moved onto a ``QThread``),
the notify/decision step and the update dialog. Behaviour, threading and
worker lifecycle are unchanged — only the code's home moved.

Threading note (preserved deliberately): the controller is a ``QObject``
whose parent is the main window, so it keeps main-thread affinity. The
worker's ``done`` signal therefore delivers ``_on_update_found`` back on
the main thread via Qt's automatic queued connection — exactly as it did
when these were ``MainWindow`` methods. No lambda crosses the thread
boundary (a bound QObject method is used), which is the Py3.14-safe
pattern this project relies on.

        Safe to call from both ``_on_update_found`` (the happy path) and
        ``MainWindow.closeEvent`` (in case the worker never emitted
        ``done`` — e.g. no update available, network failure).

        The check worker runs ``check_for_update()`` which blocks in
        ``urllib.request.urlopen(..., timeout=10)``. ``quit()`` only signals
        the worker's event loop AFTER ``run()`` returns, so it cannot
        interrupt a network read that is still parked inside urlopen. If the
        user closes the window during the ~10 s window right after launch
        the old code's ``wait(1000)`` returned False and closeEvent went on
        to destroy the MainWindow with the QThread still running ("QThread:
        Destroyed while thread is still running" + possible abort()).

        Root-cause fix: (1) close the in-flight urlopen response so the
        blocked read raises and ``run()`` returns immediately; (2) wait long
        enough to cover the urlopen timeout; (3) ``terminate()`` as a last
